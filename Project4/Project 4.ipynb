    "In summary, we categorized the average salary in seniority levels and assigning high salary to those that are about the 55th percentile of their respective categories. In doing so, we are able to achieve a relatively high degree of certainty in identifying higher paying / high salary jobs (AUC > 0.8). \n",
    "\n",
    "While we can skipped the categorizing of salaries into seniority levels part, the end result will make no sense, as for example, we definitely know that senior management makes substaintially as compared to a fresh grad and they will be flagged as high paying jobs. But that information doesn't help a fresh grad identify higher paying jobs in his/her job grads.\n",

    "#### On Models used\n",
    "\n",
    "The main model of choice this time round is RandomForestClassifier as it provides us with feature importances information to ponder on. ANN is another model used in the analysis. While ANN gave slightly lower AUC score and accuracy, it took a significant less time and computing resource (Grid Searching RDF took an incredebly long time) to reach a similar level of efficacy as RandomForestClassifier. As such, if make good predictions is the only concern and resources are tight. Use ANN.\n",

    "#### In review for Bonus question\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it is mentioned that, our boss would VERY MUCH LIKE TO AVOID telling a client that a job is a high salary one when it is indeed low salary. We amped up the probability threshold till a point where the precision of predicting high salary in the train set is 1 / 100% / perfect. \n",
    "\n",
    "In that sense, although we might wrongly predict a high salary job as low salary, nobody will actually blame the headhunter for these kinds of 'good/happy mistakes'. Furthermore, when we predict a job as a high salary, we will only be wrong very infrequently\n",

    "#### Factors distinguishing job categories\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Data Scientist vs Others\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there is only a small occurance of of 'Data Scientist' Job_Titles (<3%) , we are dealing we a serious class imbalance here. \n",
    "\n",
    "That said, that still yielded us a relatively decent AUC, precision, and recall accross both train / training and test sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Extracting the feature importance tells us that Data Scientist jobs often require data science related technical skills such as 'tensorflow', 'deep learning', 'machine learning', 'python', etc. Which makes sense, but most importantly, it tells us that emplyoers are looking for hard skills as apposed to soft skills or other skill sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Management vs Non-Management\n",
    "\n",
    "Simiar to part 2.0, class imbalance, though, not as serious as before (~10%). That said, we can still extract feature importance from it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The feature importance output suggests that regardless of Job Titles, etc. Recruiters are looking for soft skills / leadership skills to hire for Management level jobs. Meaning, one would need to focus on and prove that these skills are present in yourself in order to score the job.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing this will help one position oneself for the true requirements of a job.\n"
